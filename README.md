## Hi, i'm Lenny the burger ðŸ”¦-------ðŸ”º
I mostly do computer graphics, light transport research, sometimes web development.

Right now im mostly programming in c++, working on the [Kenos engine](https://github.com/Lenny-the-burger/Kenos), but I can work in almost any language, java, javascrypt, lua, really anything. I know Directx11 fairly well, and am very familiar with the source engine.
