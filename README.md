## Projects
- [Jackhammer entity tool](https://github.com/Lenny-the-burger/jackhammer-entity-tool)
- {name not finalized} web-based school administration software. Code not avilable, commercial product.
- BellApp (software for ringing school bells) old code and is no longer supported.

More projects are in the works but are mostly too incomplete. More things will be publisized and current ones finished once I finish the current project, as I am working with a deadline and don't really have time for other things. Many minor projects are not published.
